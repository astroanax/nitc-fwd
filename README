nitc-fwd
========

A python "daemon"/CLI that tries to keep you logged into the NITC Firewall
To install, run "pip install --user ." (Arch users use "pipx install ." instead)
Run nitc-fwd for the first time to store your username and password
It will automatically log you in from the next run onwards, and logout on kill/reboot

Use "nohup nitc-fwd &" to run it in the background (like a daemon)
or use the systemd service file. Change the path to nitc-fwd in the file,
copy it to ~/.config/systemd/user and run "systemd --user enable --now nitc-fwd"

To use the CLI, run "nitc-fwd login" to login
"nitc-fwd logout" to logout
"nitc-fwd refresh" to refresh the keepalive
