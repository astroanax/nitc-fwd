nitc-fwd
========

A python "daemon"/CLI that tries to keep you logged into the NITC Firewall
Run nitc-fwd.py for the first time to store your username and password
It will automatically log you in from the next run onwards, and logout on kill/reboot

Use "nohup ./nitc-fwd.py &" to run it in the background (like a daemon)
or use the systemd service file. Change the path to nitc-fwd.py in the file,
copy it to ~/.config/systemd/user and run "systemd --user enable --now nitc-fwd"

To use the CLI, run "./nitc-fwd.py login" to login
and "./nitc-fwd.py logout" to logout
